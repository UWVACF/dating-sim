you hear form the distance at your cubical "happy bday!!!!'
oh no
that co-worker who has been helping you the whole time and mentored you and whom you've developed a wonderful working relationship with! it's their birthday!!! and you don't have anything to show for it you heartless bastard!
how could you forget, when they told you it's coming up soon and even invited you to their birthday party! which is happening, today!
dang it
better go scramble for a gift during lunch break. do you think a tims hortan card is good enough?
nvm, the closest tim hortan is an hour drive away, and your lunch break ends in 30 minutes.
maybe you can do some arts and crafts in the lounge. Just print out a birthday card and sign it. No on will know.
oh wait, there's a cake on the counter. You check it for a name of an owner. There is none. 
Well it's yours now! how convinient.

you're in the lounge. suddenlly you can an email telling eveyone but the person to get in the lounge for the party. roll a deception check. Nat 20!
Dr. Aikha eyes you, raising an eyebrow. But they didn't ask. What's the worse that will happen? Ace.
what flvor is it? you look down at the pristine icing on the cake. it's birthday cake flavoured. It's a birthday cake that is birthday cake flavoured, as all birthday cakes should be.
How convinient that nobody has an allergy to birthday cakes.
(uh oh, the founder seems to be allergic to sprinkles. luckily, it's a sprinkly free confetti cake. so it is edible to those with sprinkle allergies.) > last slice

slice cake open, all sorts of flavours/colors
wow you must have put a lot of effort in this
start desperatly listing the filling and flavours: blood velvet, dirt, eyeball filling, turnip, egg, strawberry tall cake, sponge (non-edible) cake, cinqo leche (almond, soy, expired, ), angel dust (cocain), sheet cake (paper), black forest (with wood, sawdust and rice crispies), ice cube cake (it's just ice, now water), invisible and incoporal cake (it's just air), pinapple right-side-up cake, pop cake (with jam and a popsticle stick so you can pick it up to eat it), chocolate coke cake (also cocain), dehydrated cake, bun cake (a bun that is cake shaped), butter cake (it's just butter), pound cake (british currency), catapilliar cake (no catapilliars are harmed in the process of making this), cheesecake (a wheel of brie, not for those latose intorlerant), coffee cake (it's just coffee grounds with wipped cream on top), marble cake (hallow cake with round marble filling), and...singlular confetti cake (25)

you serve the cakes. This party has gone well and you are now remembered as a great friend. Surely nothing will go wrong.
pop! uh oh.
