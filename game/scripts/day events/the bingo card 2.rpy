# caffi, helco, deceased, uriel, ryz

# player is playing this time- 6 players
# prize: miku keychain
# caffi - does not tell helco how to play correctly, decently competitive when closed to winning
# helco - there for fun, isn't playing the game properly, he marks everything, and erases boxes randomly. doesn't know he could've "won"
# deceased - very competitive (miku keychain)
# uriel - extreme lawful competitive
# ryz - moral competitive (less than uriel)

# short intro dr ryz clearifies the rules (not enforced but anyways)
    # supposingly, not allowed to forcefully make what's on your bingo card happen
    # not supposed to peek at other's card
    # tell the player normal bingo rules

# plot
# player takes over for dr aikha
# player CAN win
# peek at helco's card (he's not really hiding it), see him playing wrong. everyong minus uriel saw helco's card, no one really say anything because 1 less competitor
# caffi sabotages dr. ryz's attempts at ticking boxes off

    # game begins
    # tension, someone else probably initiate something
    # you see helco's card, it is wrong. You see Caffi giggling on the side
        # choice:
            # tell him he's playing wrong +1 -> jump help helco
            # do not tell him  -1 -> jump don't help helco

        # help helco (gain +1 for helco, make sure you can only gain one more +1)
            # deceased finds hampter's wires
            # a wal walk past outside. You look at your winning box (start a fire)
            ## Choice: stick to the rules or cheat by attempting to combust a wal
            # so either stick to the rules (uriel +1), caffi stabotages dr ryz, you win
                # decide not to cheat (don't show the wires to the wal)
                # since you've decided not to cheat, you next winning bet is to make someone leave the room without the door.
                # hm. the only one who can leave this way is dr. ryz. How can you convince him to leave by phasing through the wall, without it being cheating?
                # you noticed someone else who is also looking at dr ryz. It is caffi, who is peeking at dr ryz's biogo sheet. she has a grimlin smile on her face.
                # dr chan walks past outside "what the fuck are you guys doing", ethy screams at caffi
                # caffi downs an entire pot of coffee while laughing at dr ryz
                # dr ryz flipps off caffi, you win

            # you were exposed of cheating and deceased wins (dece +1)
                # attempted to take the wires from deceased to show to the wal to get it to combust
                # deceased calls you out, others agree due to how destructive that could've been (and incident reports to write)
                # spiteful, you grab the miku and run out of the hallway. unfortunately you run into pochi, who takes an interest in your loot. he chomp on your hand and taks it from you.
                # deceased wins as <pochi commits thievery>. Happy with her miku prize

        # don't help helco (Can still gain +1 for 2 more person)
            # everyone is just tense and not doing anything.
            # an hour pass...you break is over. You really should get going.
            # you forfit - ryz gets a point for "someone forfits the game" ryz +1
            ## Choice: + point deceased OR Uriel 
            # deceased pspspspsp at you (or hand you a slip of paper) while you get your coffee, whispers to you to help them win the miku by <doing something that's definitely breaking the rules and may get you on uriel's bad side>
            # Choice: help deceased (+1) or don't help deceased and report them (uriel +1)
            # Help deceased:
                # insert kind of dubius thing here
                # 
            # Don't help Uriel: you stick to the rules (uriel +1) and ryz wins <someone gets reported for cheating>
