#### CRIME SCENE ####
# victim is beloved co-founder dr ralex

# Co - founder (not real, anti cameo)
    # lore accurate 
    # dr alex's twin, who also has immortality, and the immortal snail


# reason to pick up knife
# making sandwich for lunch? picks up knife from counter
# Dr. deceased walks in (witness), triggers anomaly effect to show corpse
# Dr. deceased yell and a crowd gathers
# choice: 
    # truth - idk what is going on
    # lie - make up excuses
    # deflect - no YOU killed the co founder 

    # truth chan +1
        # overexplains, seems even more suspecious. no one believes you 
        # you are dragged away into confinments by wal bots

    # lie - chan -1
        # "he ran into my knife volunterrily"
        # "I was just testing how sharp it was"
        # you are dragged away into confinments by wal bots

    # deflect
        # dr deceased "..."
        # "Oh shit did i?"
        # choice: 
            # good argument -> dr deceased as the defendent in trial and error, deceased -1
            # bad argument -> you are on trial, dr deceased +1

# visitors during confinement - chan, uriel, syg (only truth or lie)
    # uriel: do you need a lawer to represent you (foundation's right to appoint on, uriel is hence obligated to ask as the legal head) 
    # syg: if you get death-rowed can i feed you to the demons (will avocate for death row)
